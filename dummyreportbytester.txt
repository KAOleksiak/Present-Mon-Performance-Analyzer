Tester 1: At the beginning of the day, we checked the configuration left for the soak test, which consisted of an AMD Ryzen 5 4500 processor, an AMD Radeon RX 590 graphics card, and 16 GB of RAM. The soak test was successfully completed with no signs of performance degradation after its conclusion. Further tests were conducted on the following configurations: Intel Core i3-13100F with AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT and 16 GB RAM, as well as AMD Ryzen 5 1600 with AMD Radeon RX 570 and 8 GB RAM. During the tests, we paid particular attention to transitioning between levels, following the descriptions in the level documentation file. Additionally, we performed standard functional tests, checking the ability to install the game without issues, ensuring the beta code worked correctly, verifying that the game language was only English, confirming that the game title was displayed under the player's profile name and friends' profile names, and assessing playability in both online and offline modes. We also verified the ability to launch the game via a shortcut and checked that upon logging out, the game prompted for Steam account login. No graphical issues or artifacts were detected, and Vsync functioned as expected. The previously noted issue remains present across all tested configurations, where the game reduces its window size in Fullscreen mode when interrupted if it has a different resolution than the monitor. The Alt+Tab combination works correctly, switching focus to another window, quick settings can be accessed, and the Win+D combination minimizes the game without issues. The Win+L combination logs the user out, and upon re-login, the game remains stable. The Snipping Tool functions correctly for taking screenshots, the platform's overlay does not negatively impact game performance, and it is possible to exit the game via the main menu, the platform's UI, and the overlay. The Alt+F4 combination successfully closes the game, and it can also be closed via the Task Manager and from the taskbar. No crashes or freezes were detected, and the game remained stable under stress testing. The title does not include DLSS or FSR options, but this did not negatively affect the test results. The tests were successfully completed on all configurations, except for the previously mentioned issue with Fullscreen window resizing. The game's stability and functionality were confirmed.
Tester 2: Today's tests were conducted on PC-10, equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X processor, Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 graphics card, 16GB RAM, and Windows 10. The game performed reliably throughout the testing process, with no critical errors or crashes. The installation was completed without issues, with all necessary files present and correctly installed. The game launched successfully in both online and offline modes, with login authentication working as expected. No connectivity issues or server-related problems were encountered during online sessions.
Graphical performance was stable across different scenarios, with smooth frame rates, no noticeable stuttering, screen tearing, or unexpected frame drops. All graphical settings were applied correctly, and switching between different presets did not cause performance degradation or instability. The game remained fully responsive when using system functions such as Alt+Tab, Ctrl+Alt+Delete, and Windows+D. Background applications running simultaneously, including monitoring tools and communication software, did not impact stability. The Steam overlay functioned correctly, and the game could be exited normally without freezing or errors.
Performance was consistent across various in-game locations, with no significant slowdowns even in more graphically intensive areas. Extended play sessions did not reveal any memory leaks, sudden performance drops, or overheating issues. Additionally, the configuration tested yesterday on PC-06 successfully passed the soak test, confirming that the game remains stable over long gameplay periods without unexpected crashes, frame rate degradation, or resource management issues.
Overall, the game demonstrated strong performance under standard conditions, with no major problems affecting playability, system responsiveness, or graphical output. Further tests will be conducted to evaluate how the game handles prolonged high-load scenarios and extreme settings to ensure continued stability across different hardware configurations.
Tester 3: During today's tests, we focused on completed performance tests on the GPC-1141 device, and then we performed the whole suite test for the GPC-389 device. We confirmed that the title could be installed, uninstalled, and booted in both online and offline modes without any issues. The relevant title name was displayed under the user name in the profile and friend list. After changing the in-game resolution to a value higher than the display causes, the navigation did not reflect the position of the cursor in the menu. We did not find any graphical artifacts during the entire day of testing. What is more, using keyboard shortcuts results in the game's window being reduced in size when a title was running at a resolution different from the monitor's native resolution on fullscreen. Additionally, enabling Vsync when the framerate limiter was set to a value lower than the display refresh rate did not cause the refresh rate to match that of the display. The title could be closed by pressing close on a title window, using the task manager, the platform user interface, the shortcut ALT+F4, or in-game settings. Finally, we noted no performance issues on any of the devices tested today. The title was stable in all areas without any crashes, freezes, or unresponsive screens.
The team has started today’s testing by verifying the results of the soak test on the computer labelled as PC-07. The playable character was still present on the map and could move as well as interact with everything. Furthermore, no visual issues were present and there was no significant performance drop. Later, we continued to the test suite, confirming as passed every test case in the “stability” and “performance” scenarios. The team has also recorded the 5-minute performance using the “PresentMon” software on every map available in the debug. After that, we have started testing new device labelled as PC-24. However, the performance on this configuration, probably since this configuration has only integrated in the CPU graphic card. The configuration was replaced with the new one, labelled as 24.1. While testing the new configuration, the team has verified that the game can be installed on the device. Moreover, the name of the title displayed on Steam was updated to include the branch name, and additional files began downloading upon selecting a different branch. Within the Steam environment, the name of the title is displayed under the profile name of the user, and in the Steam overlay, it is shown under the friends' name profile. This ensures that users and their friends can easily identify the game being played. We confirmed that the game can be launched in both online and offline modes. The title can be started when Steam is in offline mode, and it can also be launched when the device is not connected to the network. Additionally, the title can be launched using a desktop shortcut. Throughout the testing, no visual issues were detected. When the Vsync option is enabled, the FPS is limited to match the refresh rate of the monitor. This option can be disabled, allowing the FPS to be limited to a value set in the Framerate settings. All options within the game could be applied without any problems. The team also recorded the performance on this device with the exact set-up as on the previous configuration. When the team has completed all test cases available for this configuration, we have moved to the next one. We chose PC-17 but unfortunately, the processor was not available for the test team anymore, and we needed to change this configuration. We have changed the CPU to a slightly newer model (Intel Core i5-7500) but the rest of the components remained the same. The team has confirmed that the game can be installed as well as interrupted and exited using all possible ways.
Tester 4: As for today's testing activities, we went back to gather performance logs and perform the client's request on PC-12. Performance logs from every in-game stage were gathered with help of Intel PresentMon software. Collected logs were uploaded for later analysis. The request results went as follows when in-game settings were set to 1920x1080 fullscreen with no frame limits and Vsync turned off:
On PC-12 all test suite cases except the soak test, performance testing, uninstalling the title, and the client's request were performed. Without going into too much detail, the results were similar to those observed on PC-12 and PC-13 in prior days. The compat branch of the title could be downloaded and it was named correctly. The game could be launched when Steam was in both Online and Offline mode. Launching the game via a desktop icon was impossible without a successful login attempt. Steam overlay displayed the correct game name for the user and their friends. Besides the two reported issues concerning settings, no new ones were found. Enabling Vsync when framerate limiter was set to a value lower than refresh rate of the display, did not update the framerate. Setting in-game resolution to a value higher than the display caused navigation not to reflect cursor placement in menus. Applying the prime95 stress test did not cause the title to freeze or crash. Interrupting the title when it was running in fullscreen mode with different resolution than that of the displays resolution still caused issues. Similarly, with trying to invoke the snipping tool. The game gracefully handled closing itself via methods covered in the test suite.
